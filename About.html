        <h2 style = "text-align: left;">Hello, my name is Lorna.  A bit about myself</h2>
        <br> I’m a proud K-State Wildcat and a longtime enthusiast of Japan and Japanese culture. The photo in the background is one I captured myself while visiting Mount Fuji—a trip that deepened my appreciation for the country even more. I’ve been an active volunteer with the local anime organization, Naka-Kon, for over 15 years, serving in a variety of roles from staff member to director. I’m also involved with the local Japan-America association, where I’ve had the honor of serving on the Board of Directors for three years.

        When I’m not working with my organizations, you can usually find me cross-stitching, diving into a good book, spending time with friends, or exploring shows across the many streaming services I subscribe to.    </p>
   
    <h2> Education</h2>
    <p>
        I have a Computer Science degree from College of Engineering from Kansas State University in Manhattan, KS. When I was at school, we mainly did backend coding and not much frontend.
        However, I decided to learn more about frontend development, so I signed up for a certificate program through Emeritus x MIT.
        I finished that program in April with a Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack development with MERN. I have other degrees and certificate they come from Johnson County Community College in Overland Park, Ks.
        If you can't tell I love to learn!
